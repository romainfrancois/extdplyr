Description: If `dplyr` is a grammar for data manipulation, `extdplyr` is like
    a short paragraph written in `dplyr`. `extdplyr` extends `dplyr` and
    `tidyr` verbs to some common "routines" that manipulate datasets. It uses
    the same interface and preserves all features from `dplyr` like fast
    performance and various data sources.
